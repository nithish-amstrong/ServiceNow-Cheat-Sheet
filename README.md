## üß† Best Practices

- **Client vs Server**: Use Client Scripts for UI, Business Rules for backend logic.
- **Declarative First**: Prefer no-code tools like UI Policy and Flow Designer before scripting.
- **Modern Tools**: Use Flow Designer and IntegrationHub instead of legacy Workflows/SOAP.
- **Scoped Apps**: Avoid conflicts by using scoped app containers.
- **Security First**: Plan ACLs, roles, and user groups up front.
